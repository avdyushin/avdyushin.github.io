= x86 on Raspberry Pi
:page-tags: [retro, raspberry pi]

Running x86 (including Windows) binaries on Raspberry Pi4.

== Pre requirements

* Raspberry Pi4 running Pi OS
* Terminal usage skills
* Plenty of time

== The plan

The goal is to run old (from 2000) Windows games on Raspberry Pi4.
As CPU we have is ARM and not x86 we can just install/run Wine.
To so we have to able to run x86 Linux binaries first and then focus on Windows'.

* Install `box86`
* Install `Wine`
* Run some `*.exe` files

=== Installing box86

Verify if `cmake` and `git` present on the machine or install using command:

----
$ sudo apt-get install cmake git
----

Clone and install `box86`:

----
$
----

=== Installing Wine

Fetch binaries for i386 platform and extract them:

----
$ 
----

=== Running Windows binaries

How cool is that, running Windows binaries on ARM Linux embedded device?
