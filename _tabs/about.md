Here is yet another start to post (and maintain) my personal articles, comments or other technical stuff.
Some of the them just a summary, terminal commands or code snippets after of hours of research how to achieve something.

I've spent a lot of time looking into blue `DOS` screen running `NC` and `Turbo Pascal`.
Running compiler and linker with the help of my father.

```nasm
MOV AH, 2Ah
INT 21h ; I do remember CX contained 1998 or so
```

Then later black screen running `Linux` terminal and looking for the way to exit from `Vim` (or stop it beeping at least).

Most used commands back in a days:

```console
$ uptime
$ uname -a
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
$ irssi # even without Internet we had local networks / servers
```

I had to keep my PC running whole night only to be able to compile latest Linux kernel with modules I need.

Some sports I like to do: trail running, cycling, street football and SUP.
